A fork of CIT Resewn for the Forge Mod Loader. It is a standalone implementation of MCPatcher's CIT features (most commonly found in OptiFine).

> Because not everyone should have to use OptiFine

## Download
Releases are available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/citreforged).

## Ethos
The existence of this fork is driven purely by the requirements of a separate project I am involved in. As a result, the development direction is largely dictated that other project. I am unlikely to do any work that isn't specifically needed by it. That being said, contributions are welcome if you find that some of the corners I have cut are not acceptable for your needs.

## Versions
- 1.18.2
- 1.19.4
- 1.20.1
- 1.20.6 (planned)

## Changes
- Defaults is no longer a seperate mod
- Fabric-specific entrypoints have been removed in favour of an SPI
- The commands and configuration GUIs have been removed

## Documentation
This project does not have it's own documentation, however generally the upstream documentation at https://citresewn.shcm.io should be sufficient
